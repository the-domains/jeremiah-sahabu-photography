Content Creator: Jeremiah Sahabu aka.. Mr. Disney 

Hi, my name is JJ and I am one of the content creators on this page. I am a third year here at the University of California, Berkeley studying Business Administration and a minior in chemistry. In my free time, I love to travel, eat creative desserts, and of course, go to Disneyland. I started photography back when I was in the 8th grade on my first trip to China and I know take photographs professionally as well as for University of California, Berkeley's Blue and Gold Yearbook. 

My art form for my photography stresses on the natural elements in life, focusing on the details of light composition and facial expression. I love taking photos with a shallow depth of field so that my focus is always on the target and that the background is simply just to add to the ambience of the target. Photography has been a big part in life and I have been fine tuning my art practice for 6 years.
